## Windows configurations before running

Before running ansible playbook there's some changes to be made on windows machine first.

### Enable Windows Remote Management (WinRM)

Ansible will use WinRM protocol to connect the windows machine.

1. Make the network private

2. Enable WinRM from powershell (Run as Administrator)
```powershell
winrm quickconfig
winrm set winrm/config/service/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
winrm set winrm/config/service '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'
```


3. Disable Windows Defender and Firewall

4. Disable User Account Control Settings (UAC)

5. Make sure that the user is in **Administrators** group

### Initiate the installation

After cloning the BlackMega VM repository install python **winrm** module.

```bash
pip install -r requirements
```


The hosts credentials should be stored at `hosts.ini` file like following example.

```ini
[windows_box]
10.0.20.5

[windows_box:vars]
ansible_user = "admin_user"
ansible_password = "pass123"
ansible_port = 5985
ansible_connection = winrm
ansible_winrm_transport = basic
```


Now you can start ansible playbook.

```bash
ansible-playbook start.yml -i hosts.ini
```


### Cleanup after finishing

You can now simply revert any critical you have made like disabling WinRM, Reactivate the UAC.

In `Desktop\My_Tools\Maintainance` folder you will see some tools that will help you enable any disabled services like windows updates, edge blocking, etc.
